Before beginning to work on our project we had many discussions for requirement elicitation. 
This was useful so that we could have starting point on what should be included in our first prototype.
We used prototyping as our main process in order to develop this bot. 
Our team would meet and rework our prototype in order to address our problem statement. 
We often would think of criteria that our users would want/need. 
This was useful so that we were all on the same page on how we should build our bot.
In order to split the work evenly we used scrum and kanban. 
We had a shared Google Keep note of all the tasks we needed to complete for the next milestone and would share over slack our progress after class weekly.
Tools Used: Google Slides, Figma, Google Keep, Adobe Illustrator
